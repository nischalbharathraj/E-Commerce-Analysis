Analysis and visualization of Sales of E-commerce:
This dashboard offers a holistic view of e-commerce performance, focusing on sales metrics, customer insights, and product/category-level analysis to help drive better business decisions.

1)I have provided an overview of critical metrics such as the total sales amount (438K), total profit (37K), average order value (121.01K), and total quantity sold (5615). These KPIs give a quick snapshot of the overall sales performance.

Monthly Profit Analysis:
2)I’ve visualized the "Sum of Profit by Month" to display profit trends over the year. For instance, months like January and December show higher profits, whereas some months like June and August indicate lower or negative profits, helping to identify seasonal patterns or potential issues.

Top Customers Analysis:
3)Using the "Top Buying Customer Names" chart, I’ve highlighted the most valuable customers, with Harivansh and Madhav leading the list. This analysis helps in understanding who the top buyers are, which can guide personalized marketing and retention strategies.

City-wise Sales Contribution:
4)I’ve included a "Contribution by City" chart that shows cities like Indore and Mumbai contributing the most to overall sales. This allows me to assess the regional performance and plan location-based marketing or inventory strategies accordingly.

Product and Category Breakdown:
5)I have broken down product performance with the "Sum of Quantity by Sub-Category" chart, where products like Sarees and Handkerchiefs are the highest sold. Additionally, the "Sum of Profit by Category" shows Clothing and Electronics as the most profitable categories (36% each), followed by Furniture (28%), providing a clear view of category-wise profitability.
